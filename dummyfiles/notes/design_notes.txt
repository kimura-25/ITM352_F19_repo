1) Data source: embed in HTML file
2) Functionality: display products, ability to take quantities for each item and calculate final price
3) How do form processing: online??
4) Validation needed: if quantity is an integer, are you a human, 

On server, want to make sure want to actually process form data on server
Don't want it to send to page itself - data goes nowhere

server should not only get display page, but when user submits form, want to validate data on the server

bare minimum
-server that starts up a listening (HAVE to use port 8080)

starting point if want to use POST:
app.use(myParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.post("/process_form", function (request, response) {
   let POST = request.body;
   response.send(POST); 
});

can have hit back button to recognize error
do code on server, process form
